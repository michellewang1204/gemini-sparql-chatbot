#  Gemini SPARQL Question Answering Bot

This is a command-line chatbot that uses [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) (via `@langchain/google-genai`) to convert natural language questions into SPARQL queries and execute them on the [DBpedia SPARQL endpoint](https://dbpedia.org/sparql).

##  Result Demonstration

Below are sample outputs for different types of SPARQL queries generated by the chatbot. Each example shows the user question, the generated SPARQL query, and the final answer returned from DBpedia.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. SELECT Query  
**Q:** Which country has Taipei as its capital and uses Chinese as its official language?

<img src="./result1.png" width="600"/>

This query selects the country where:
- `dbo:capital` = `dbr:Taipei`
- `dbo:officialLanguage` = `dbr:Standard_Chinese`

**SPARQL Type:** `SELECT`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. ASK Query  
**Q:** Is National Chung Hsing University located in Taichung?

<img src="./result2.png" width="600"/>

This query returns a boolean (`TRUE/FALSE`) by checking:
- Whether `dbr:National_Chung_Hsing_University` has `dbo:city` = `dbr:Taichung`

**SPARQL Type:** `ASK`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. SELECT with Multiple Results  
**Q:** Which universities are located in the same district as National Chung Hsing University?

<img src="./result3.png" width="600"/>

This query selects universities sharing the same `dbo:city` value (of type `District_(Taiwan)`) as National Chung Hsing University.

**SPARQL Type:** `SELECT` with multiple bindings
